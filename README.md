# Encryption_algorithms

I made two encryption algorithms:
1. The Atbash algorithm was chosen as a symmetric algorithm using a code word.
2. The ElGamal algorithm was chosen as asymmetric.


<h2>Brief description of the program</h2>

When you run any of the algorithms, you are given the opportunity to select the mode of operation:
1. Encryption
2. Decryption

<pre>Symmetric  ---> In the case of using a symmetric algorithm (Atbash), you
           ---> needa key- a word in which no letters are repeated, then, depending
  cipher   ---> on the selected early mode, enter messages for encryption / decryption.</pre>

<pre>Asymmetric ---> In the case of a symmetric algorithm, the principle is similar, but here,
           ---> as a key, you must enter a number not exceeding 1000, then enter a message
  cipher   ---> for encryption, or the resulting sequence of numbers for decryption.</pre>
